This folder contains demos for the Python translations generated by ChatGPT from the CLM (Community Land Model) photosynthesis module. 

Especially important are:

- `parameter_estimation.ipynb` - Uses gradient descent to make model outputs match up to measured values. This wasn't possible in Fortran, since the Fortran version didn't support automatic differentiation. 
- `runtime.ipynb` - Compares runtime for the multiple versions of leaf-level photosynthesis implemented in `./.fortran` and `./python`.
